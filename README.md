# Tiro-parabolico-Juego
This is a simulator-videogame which aims to demonstrate the usefulness of mathematics in video games. For this project we use the equations of horizontal parabolic motion (Xmax), projectile height (Ymax) and time of flight (Tv). In addition, we will include Newton's second law for projectile prediction.
